# Git is fun

## This is my first repo, not really

### Github is a useful tool for version control and collaboration

My first repo created at EANBiT


Let me tell you a bit about myself. My name is *Martha* 

~~Martha likes food~~

Martha is learning **git and github** at the EANBiT residential training.

Some basic commands that I have learnt so far include
```
git clone 
git pull
git push
git merge
```
I have created a github account [here](https://github.com/marthaluka)
